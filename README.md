# University of California, Santa Cruz Data Journalism

These are my progamming and data science projects during my year at the University of California, Santa Cruz. In my Master's of Science Communication program, I want to use my abilities as a writer and data scientist in crafting stories.

These tools are for data journalists and other writers and researchers to use in reporting stories. The scripts are found in the corresponding language in the src directory. The raw input data files are found in data, and the output files are created and stored in output.
