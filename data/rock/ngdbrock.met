    Description:
      Abstract:
        This data set contains geochemical data for rock samples collected
        by U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) personnel and analyzed either in the
        analytical laboratories of the Geologic Discipline of the USGS or by
        contract with commercial analytical laboratories. These data represent
        analyses of rock samples collected in support of various USGS programs.
        In addition to recent data, this data set includes archived geochemical
        data originally entered into the in-house Rock Analysis Storage System
        (RASS) database (used by the Geologic Discipline from the mid-1960's
        through the late-1980's) and the in-house PLUTO database (used by the
        Geologic Discipline from the mid-1970's through the mid-1990's). All of
        these data are maintained in the Oracle-based National Geochemical
        Database (NGDB). A retrieval from the NGDB was used to generate this
        data set.
      Purpose:
        These data may be useful for a variety of geochemical studies; including
        mineral resource evaluation, defining geochemical baseline values and
        statistics, petrologic studies, geological mapping, and medical geology.

      Maintenance_and_Update_Frequency:
        Variable to annual, at best. The National Geochemical Database is
        currently being updated annually with new data although there is a
        deliberate lag time of 2-5 years before recent data are added. The
        error-identification and correction process continues to generate
        changes at episodic intervals. Most changes are primarly related to
        1) additional information on the exact sample medium analyzed,
        2) adding location coordinates where there were none, and
        3) correcting location coordinates known to be inaccurate.

      Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
        The historical geochemical databases of the Geologic Discipline
        in the USGS were created with the intent of storing data
        predominately for regional projects.  The new combined National
        Geochemical Database is an agglomerate of data from projects that
        had differing analytical needs and that ranged in scale from
        studies of an outcrop to reconnaissance surveys of an entire
        state or country.  Initially, the intended user of the data was
        the original submitter or associated project personnel, and the
        primary means of publicly releasing data were hardcopy USGS
        reports, as well as professional journals.  Within this paradigm,
        some decisions were made which have affected the completeness
        and accuracy of the attributes within the database.

        1) Coordinates:  When samples were brought in for analysis, the
        submitter was required to include information about the sample
        for the database; descriptions, geocoding, and latitude-longitude
        coordinates.  In the days before map digitizing boards and GPS
        units were common, the determination of coordinates from field
        sheets was a time consuming and error prone process.  In order to
        facilitate the analysis of samples, a decision was made to allow
        submitters to enter the coordinates for the lower right (southeast)
        corner of the submitter's working field map on which the samples
        could be plotted, which was most commonly a 7.5' or 15' quadrangle
        map.  In theory, the precise coordinates for these samples
        would be determined and added to the database at a later date.
        In practice, most of these precise coordinates were used in the
        USGS Open-File data releases but were never entered back into the
        PLUTO database.  Therefore, the precision of coordinates in the
        PLUTO database varies from "good to the nearest second of
        latitude or longitude" to "good to the nearest 15 minutes of
        latitude or longitude".

        2) Geocoding:  The submission of sample descriptive information
        (geocoding) with samples was mandatory for some fields and optional
        for others. Therefore, the completeness of geocoding can vary. In
        addition, most geocodes were not checked for completeness, accuracy,
        or validity during data entry into the early databases. Therefore the
        database contains some incorrect and invalid codes.

        3) Analytical Data: The samples in this data set were chemically
        analyzed by a variety of techniques over a period of time from the
        early 1960's to the present.  The accuracy of the data varies with
        the analytical methodology and with the concentration of the element
        being analyzed.

        4) Qualifiers: A qualifier such as "N" (less than the detection limit
        of the analytical method) or "G" (greater than the upper
        determination limit of the analytical method) accompanies some
        analytical data values. These qualifiers are defined as follows:

        L = the element was detected by the technique but at a level
        below the lower limit of determination for the method.  The value
        of the lower limit of determination is given in the adjacent data
        field.

        G or > = the element was measured at a concentration greater than the
        upper determination limit for the method. The upper limit of
        determination is given in the adjacent data field.

        N = the element was not detected at concentrations above the
        lower limit of determination for the method. The value of the
        lower limit of determination is given in the adjacent data field.

        < = the element concentration was determined to be less than the
        lower determination limit for the method for this element.  The value
        of the lower limit of determination is given in the adjacent data
        field.

        When appropriate, these qualifying values appear in this data set
        as a separate field following each element. The attribute, or
        field name, for the qualifier field is always denoted by the
        letter "Q".  For example, "N" in the "ASPPM_SQ" field followin an
        analytical data field labelled "ASPPM_S" would indicate the actual
        concentration of arsenic (AS) is less than the data value listed,
        which is the lower limit of determination for the method.
    Logical_Consistency_Report:
      The NGDB rock data set was constructed by processing a subset of the
      original National Geochemical Database (NGDB), checking for errors
      where possible, and using various selection criteria. The following
      criteria were chosen for selecting data for the rock data set:

      >Each sample must have a valid and unique lab number
      >Each sample must have a latitude and longitude
      >Each sample must be identified as a rock
      >Each analytical determination must be linked to a valid and unique lab number
      >Each analytical determination must be identified by analyte

      In addition, samples that could be identified as a processed
      derivative of a rock were removed from the data set.  This included
      single minerals, mineral separates, heavy-mineral concentrates, rock
      coatings, insoluble residues, partial digestions, and leachates.

      The rock samples in this data set were collected for a variety of
      purposes.  Not all samples were subject to the same sample
      preparation protocol or the same analytical protocol.
    Completeness_Report:
      This data set provides chemical data for Ag, Al, As, Au, B, Ba, Be,
      Bi, Br, Ca, Cd, Ce, Cl, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Dy, Er, Eu, Ga, Gd, Ge, F,
      Fe, Hf, Hg, Ho, I, In, Ir, K, La, Li, Lu, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Nb, Nd,
      Ni, Os, P, Pb, Pd, Pr, Pt, Rb, Re, Rh, Rn, Ru, S, Sb, Sc, Se, Si,
      Sm, Sn, Sr, Ta, Tb, Te, Th, Ti, Tl, Tm, U, V, W, Y, Yb, Zn, Zr, and
      forms of carbon.  In addition, the data set provides location and
      descriptive information for each sample.  Not all the descriptive
      fields contain information for a particular sample because it was not
      recorded by the submitter or because it was never entered into the
      database. No sample will contain analyses for all possible elements.
      The analytical methods used were selected by the sample submitter
      based on the goals of the individual project and will vary throughout
      the data set. The analytical methods, sample preparation protocols,
      and quality control protocols used for various sample media
      by the USGS are documented in the following publications:

        Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
          1) Coordinates: Most of the more recently submitted samples were
          located using GPS receivers.  The locations determined by GPS
          should be accurate to the nearest latitude or longitude second.
          Older sample locations were determined primarily from USGS
          topographic maps of various scales.  Sometimes these coordinates
          were determined directly from the original maps using a digitizing
          board.  In other cases, a clear overlay with a coordinate grid
          was used to visually estimate the sample position on the map.
          The positional accuracy is dependant on the scale of the map
          from which the determination was made as well as the care taken
          by the individual(s) who plotted the sample or who made the
          coordinate determination. Unfortunately, some location
          coordinates were not carefully determined.

          The determination of coordinates from field sheets was a time
          consuming and error prone process.  In order to facilitate the
          analysis of samples, a decision was made to allow samples to be
          submitted to the laboratory using only the coordinates for the
          lower right (southeast) corner of the submitter's working field
          map on which the samples could be plotted, which was most
          commonly a 7.5' or 15' quadrangle map.  In theory, the precise
          coordinates for these samples would be determined and added to
          the database at a later date.  In practice, most of these more
          precise coordinates were used in resultant USGS Open-File data
          releases or publications but were never entered back into the
          database.

          When submitters reported locations as degrees, minutes, and
          seconds of latitude and longitude the accuracy should be within
          a few seconds. When submitters only reported locations as
          degrees and minutes the accuracy is only to the nearest minute.
          When submitters only reported the corner coordinates of their
          field map, the accuracy is only to the nearest 7.5 or 15 minutes.

          2) Datum and Earth Ellipsoid or Spheroid:  When coordinates were
          submitted from GPS receivers or when the source of the
          coordinates were known, the datum and spheroid are identified in
          two fields that accompany the locational coordinates.  For the
          majority of the data, these fields are empty.  Since most of the
          older coordinate data in the database were determined from
          published maps, the best assumption is that the appropriate
          datum and spheroid is the one most conmmonly used for those
          types of maps.  In the United States, most field maps were USGS
          topographic maps that used NAD27 (1927 North American datum)
          based on the Clarke 1866 ellipsoid.  Using the wrong ellipsoid
          or datum may result in a location that is offset by up to a
          couple hundred feet.

        Process_Description:
          The data were generated by the Geologic Discipline analytical
          laboratories of the U.S. Geological Survey over several years,
          beginning in the early 1960s.  Upon completion of the chemical
          analysis, the data were stored in the RASS database (1963 to
          1987), the PLUTO database (1979 to 1997), or the specific
          commercial laboratory-information-management software (LIMS)
          used by the USGS analytical laboratories (1996 to present).
          Data from all three sources were combined, reformatted, and
          standardized into the Oracle-based National Geochemical
          Database (NGDB).

          To create this data set, rock sample data were retrieved from
          the NGDB using the following criteria: 1) Each sample must
          have a valid and unique lab number; 2) Each sample must have
          latitude and longitude coordinates; and 3) Each sample must be
          identified as a rock.  This data set was then examined to
          remove any samples that could be identified as a processed
          derivative of a rock.  This included single minerals, mineral
          separates, heavy-mineral concentrates, rock coatings, insoluble
          residues, partial digestions, leachates, experimental or
          artificial samples, and some misidentified samples.  An effort
          was made to fix incorrect or incomplete attributes.  Several
          standardized sample descriptive fields were more completely
          populated using information previously found only in comment
          fields. The rock sample location and descriptive data were
          repackaged into a single table called tblRockGeoData.

          Analytical data associated with these rock samples were
          retrieved from the NGDB using the following criteria: 1) Each
          analytical determination must be linked to a valid and unique
          rock sample lab number; and 2) Each analytical determination
          must be identified by analyte.  This data set was then examined
          to remove determinations that were requested but not completed,
          determinations that could not be quantified due to instrumental
          interferences, and duplicate determinations.  In addition,
          multiple variations of similar analytical methods were
          consolidated into a single method name by element. For example:
          data for 17 variations of emission spectrographic determination
          for zinc were all combined into a single field called ZNPPM_S.
          The analytical data were repackaged into 8 tables based upon the
          consolidated analytical methods: xtbMajorChem, xtbXrfChem,
          xtbNaaChem, xtbIcpaesChem, xtbIcpmsChem, xtbEsChem, xtbOtherChem,
          and xtbUnknownChem.

      Process_Step:
        Process_Description:
          Correction of locations in 9,527 records (about 2.3% of the total records), deleted locations for 17 records for which sufficient location information could not be found.

          The locations that were corrected consisted of the following types of problems:

          1. records where longitude and latitude values were switched (i.e., Samples from North Carolina that plotted in Greenland, samples from Ethiopia that plotted in the Mediterranean, etc.). Records were fixed by checking original paperwork, replacing the coordinates, and confirming the correct location by plotting in Google Earth.

          2. records where at least one of the latitude/longitude values had the wrong +/- sign (i.e. Samples from Chile that plotted in the North Atlantic, Samples from Colorado that plotted in China). Records were fixed by checking original paperwork, replacing the offending coordinate, and confirming the correct location by plotting in Google Earth.

          3. records where at least one of the latitude/longitude values had been obviously mis-entered. (i.e. Samples from California that plotted in the Atlantic because the longitude had been enter as -19 for the entire job rather than -119, a single Nevada Wilderness sample in a job where all latitudes were 39N except for 1 @ 79N). Records were fixed by checking original paperwork, replacing the offending coordinates, and confirming the correct location by plotting in Google Earth.

          4. records where the coordinates plotted samples in places that were grossly incompatible with the listed State or Country location (i.e., Samples identified as from India that plotted in Indonesia, Sample identified as from Massachusetts that plotted in the southern Pacific Ocean).  Records were fixed by checking original paperwork, plotting confirmed locations in Google Earth, and either changing the coordinates or the State/Country identifiers to match the confirmed locations

          5. records where the coordinates plotted outside of the U.S. and the State & Country fields were blank.  Records were fixed by checking original paperwork to confirm the location and then either fixing coordinates or adding the correct Country value. Locations were confirmed using Google Earth.

          6. records where the coordinates were grossly in error and no better coordinates could be found. Records were fixed by changing the offending latitude/longitude coordinates to [NULL]. This case was actually very rare and was only used for 17 records. Had these 17 records been identified previously, they would not have been included in the database.

          In all cases, the corrected records now have the best coordinates that could be found and have the Country, and where appropriate, the State field values completely populated.  Only values in the tblRockGeoData table were affected by this modification.
