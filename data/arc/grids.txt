                           GRID FILE INFORMATION


  The data published in the \ASCII directory on this CD-ROM consist of
  regular grids of ASCII values.  Each grid has a different origin and sample
  spacing as defined in its first record, the header.  The grid format is
  explained in detail below.  Each grid represents data that have been
  projected from latitude and longitude coordinates into map coordinates of
  kilometers.  Thus, the x-origin and y-origin values given in the header
  represent the distance in kilometers from the central meridian and base
  latitude of the geographic projection (discussed below) to the lower left
  corner of the grid.

  Binary versions of these grid files, suitable for processing on IBM or
  compatible personal computers using the potential-field software contained
  on this CD-ROM, are located in the \DOSBIN directory on this CD-ROM.  Use
  the EXTRACT BINARY GRID FILES submenu to access these grid files.  For more
  information on the binary grid file format and the potential-field
  software, access the POTENTIAL-FIELD SOFTWARE submenu from the MAIN menu.

                          Projection information 
      
  All grids on this CD-ROM have been projected by using an Albers equal-area
  conic projection with standard parallels of 29.5 degrees and 45.5 degrees
  north.  A central meridian of 96 degrees west and a base latitude of 0
  degrees were used.  The projection is referenced to the Clarke 1866
  ellipsoid, which has an equatorial radius of 6378.2064 km and a polar
  radius of 6356.5838 km.
      
                                Grid format 
      
  Each ASCII grid consists of two header records followed by a series of data
  records.  The first header record contains 56 alphanumeric characters of
  data identification, 8 alphanumeric characters containing the name of the
  computer program that created the grid, the integer number of columns in
  the grid, and the integer number of rows in the grid.  The second header
  record contains a dummy integer value of 1, the x-coordinate in kilometers
  of the first (leftmost) column, the distance in kilometers between columns
  of the grid, the y-coordinate in kilometers of the first (bottommost) row
  of the grid, and the distance in kilometers between rows of the grid.

  Each data record contains five values in scientific notation.  The
  bottommost row is presented first, starting from the leftmost column.  The
  first value in each row is a dummy value, usually zero (0.000000000E+00).
  If a row ends in the middle of a record, the record is padded with zeros.
  Areas of the grid containing no data are represented by a special value,
  0.999999968E+38.

                          The gamma-ray data grids

  Aerial gamma-ray surveys measure the gamma-ray flux produced by the
  radioactive decay of the naturally occurring elements K-40, U-238, and
  Th-232 in the top few centimeters of rock or soil (Duval, Cook, and Adams,
  1971).  If the gamma-ray system is properly calibrated (for example, see
  Grasty and Darnley, 1971), the data can be expressed in terms of the
  estimated concentrations of the radioactive elements.  The potassium
  concentration data are usually expressed in units of percent potassium
  (percent K), uranium as parts per million equivalent uranium (ppm eU), and
  the thorium as parts per million equivalent thorium  (ppm eTh).  The term
  equivalent is used because the technique actually measures the gamma-ray
  flux from the decay of bismuth (Bi-214), which is a decay product of U-238,
  and from the decay of thallium (Tl-208), which is a decay product of
  Th-232.  Radioactive disequilibrium in the thorium decay series may cause
  the measured equivalent uranium and equivalent thorium to differ from the
  actual uranium and  thorium present in the surface rocks and soils.
  Because Rn-222 is a daughter product of the U-238 decay series, the U-238
  concentrations can also be used to estimate the amounts of Rn-222 in the
  near-surface soil gas.

  During the period 1975-83, the U.S. Department of Energy carried out the
  National Uranium Resource Evaluation (NURE) Program, which included aerial
  gamma-ray surveys of most of the conterminous United States.  Although many
  of the airborne gamma-ray systems used to make these surveys were
  calibrated, many of the earlier surveys were done without calibration and
  conversion to the concentrations of the radioactive elements.  Detailed
  examinations of the digital data available on magnetic tape also showed
  that many of the "calibrated" surveys do not match the data from other
  "calibrated" surveys of adjacent areas.  For these reasons, the data must
  be corrected to obtain a consistent data base for the conterminous United
  States.

  Because  uranium, thorium, and potassium concentration data are useful in
  geologic studies and because the NURE data are the only nationwide data
  base on the natural radiation environment, the U.S. Geological Survey
  (USGS) reprocessed the aerial gamma-ray data to produce maps showing
  surface concentrations of potassium, uranium, and thorium for the
  conterminous United States.  These maps have been released as USGS Open-
  File Reports (Duval and others, 1989, 1990).  Some of the reprocessed data
  have also been released in profile form (Duval, 1995).
      
                      The magnetic anomaly data grid 
      
  Magnetic anomalies are produced by variations in the distribution of iron
  minerals, usually magnetite, in the rocks of the Earth's crust.  Igneous
  and metamorphic rocks can be very magnetic.  By comparison, sedimentary
  rocks are usually nonmagnetic.  Magnetic anomalies therefore provide a way
  of mapping exposed and buried crystalline rocks.

  The grid of magnetic anomaly data for the conterminous United States and
  adjacent marine areas (Godson, 1986) was created from digitized contours of
  the east half of the Composite Magnetic Anomaly Map of the United States,
  Part A (U.S. Geological Survey, 1982), and the Composite Magnetic Anomaly
  Map of the Conterminous United States West of 96 Degrees Longitude (Bond
  and Zietz, 1987),with additional data used in the compilation of the
  Magnetic Anomaly Map of North America (Geological Society of America,
  Committee for the Magnetic Anomaly Map of North America, 1987).  A
  regional gradient present in the 1982 map was removed by using a corrected
  geomagnetic reference field (Godson, 1986).  The data, originally gridded
  on a 2-km interval using the spherical Transverse Mercator projection of
  the Magnetic Anomaly Map of North America, were reprojected to the Albers
  projection used on this CD-ROM and regridded on a 2-km interval using a
  minimum curvature gridding program (Webring, 1981).  An interpretation of
  the 1982 anomaly map was presented by Hinze and Zietz (1985).
      
                   The Bouguer gravity anomaly data grid 
      
  Gravity anomalies are produced by density variations within the rocks of
  the Earth's crust and upper mantle.  Mapping of these density variations is
  the primary use of gravity anomalies.

  Gravity measurements made on the surface of the Earth must be corrected in
  various ways before they can be made into an anomaly map.  The free-air
  correction reduces the measurement to sea level by assuming that there is
  no intervening mass.  The simple Bouguer correction accounts for the
  intervening mass as a uniform slab of constant density, and the complete
  Bouguer correction includes the effects of constant density topography
  within 166.7 km of the measurement location.  A gravity reference field is
  subtracted from the corrected measurements to produce the free-air, simple
  Bouguer, or complete Bouguer anomaly.
      
  The grid of gravity data for the conterminous United States and adjacent
  marine areas (Godson and Scheibe, 1982; Godson, 1985) was constructed from
  Defense Mapping Agency gravity data files.  The onshore data consisted of
  nearly one million Bouguer gravity anomaly values computed by using a
  reduction density of 2.67 grams per cubic centimeter.  The offshore data
  consisted of approximately 800,000 free-air gravity anomaly values.
  Because the Bouguer anomaly equals the free-air anomaly at sea level, there
  is no discontinuity in the gridded data at the shoreline.  All computations
  were performed by using the International Gravity Standardization Net of
  1971 (International Association of Geodesy, 1974) and the 1967 Geodetic
  Reference System formula for theoretical gravity (International Association
  of Geodesy, 1971).
       
  In areas of substantial relief, terrain corrections were computed about
  each station location at radial distances of 0.895 km to 166.7 km by using
  a density of 2.67 grams per cubic centimeter.  The data were projected and
  gridded on a 4-km interval using minimum curvature (Webring, 1981).  The
  gridding procedure resulted in the extrapolation of grid values up to 40 km
  beyond the limits of the data; therefore, values around the edges should be
  viewed with caution.  These gridded data were published in map form as the
  Gravity Anomaly Map of the United States (Society of Exploration
  Geophysicists, 1982).  This map was further discussed by O'Hara and Lyons
  (1985) and Kane and Godson (1985, 1989).
      
             The isostatic residual gravity anomaly data grid 
      
  Isostatic residual gravity anomaly maps are produced by subtracting long-
  wavelength anomalies produced by masses deep within the crust or mantle
  from the Bouguer anomaly  map.  The long-wavelength anomalies are assumed
  to result from isostatic compensation of topographic loads.  Isostatic
  residual gravity anomaly maps therefore reveal more clearly than Bouguer
  anomaly maps the density distributions within the upper crust that are of
  interest in many geologic and tectonic studies.
      
  The grid of isostatic residual gravity anomaly data (Simpson and others,
  1986) was produced from the grid of Bouguer gravity anomaly data (Godson
  and Scheibe, 1982) by using an Airy-Heiskanen compensation model (Heiskanen
  and Moritz, 1967) with three parameters.  The depth to the compensating
  root at sea level was chosen to be 30 km.  The density contrast across the
  root was chosen to be 0.35 grams per cubic centimeter, and the density of
  the topography was chosen to be 2.67 grams per cubic centimeter.  Other
  reasonable choices of these parameters would produce similar-looking
  residual maps.
      
  The computer program and topographic data sets used to produce the data
  grid were described by Simpson and others (1983a,b). The data were
  published in map form by Jachens and others (1985).  Interpretations of the
  isostatic residual gravity anomaly map were presented by Simpson and others
  (1986) and by Jachens and others (1989).
      
                         The topographic data grid 
      
  The topographic data grid for the conterminous United States and adjacent
  areas was constructed from 30x30 second digital terrain files used by the
  U.S. Geological Survey for the reduction of gravity data.  Elevations are
  in meters; sea level elevations are listed as 1 meter.

                   The topographic-bathymetric data grid 
      
  The topographic and bathymetric data grid for the conterminous United
  States and adjacent areas was constructed from 5x5 minute North American
  topographic data and 5x5 minute Synthetic Bathymetric Profiling System data
  available from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  The
  data were interpolated onto an 8x8 km grid in the Albers projection
  (Simpson and others, 1983b).  Elevation units are in meters relative to sea
  level.
